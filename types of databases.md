**Types of DBMS**

1. **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**:
   - Organizes data into tables (relations).
   - Uses SQL for data manipulation and querying.
   - Ensures data integrity through normalization.
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

2. **NoSQL DBMS**:
   - Handles unstructured or semi-structured data.
   - Scalable for large data volumes and distributed systems.
   - Types: Document-oriented (MongoDB), Key-Value (Redis), Columnar (Cassandra).

3. **Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)**:
   - Stores objects (data and methods) as entities.
   - Suitable for complex data structures.
   - Supports object-oriented programming.
   - Examples: db4o, ObjectStore.

4. **Graph DBMS**:
   - Focuses on relationships between data elements.
   - Efficient for querying connected data.
   - Suitable for social networks, recommendation systems.
   - Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

5. **Columnar DBMS**:
   - Stores data in columns rather than rows.
   - Optimized for analytical queries.
   - Faster for aggregations and reporting.
   - Examples: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery.

6. **In-Memory DBMS**:
   - Stores data in RAM for faster retrieval.
   - High performance for real-time applications.
   - Suitable for caching and analytics.
   - Examples: SAP HANA, Redis (as in-memory cache).

7. **Time-Series DBMS**:
   - Specialized for handling time-series data (timestamps).
   - Efficient for IoT, monitoring, financial data.
   - Supports data compression and retention.
   - Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.

8. **NewSQL DBMS**:
   - Modern approach with ACID compliance.
   - Scales horizontally like NoSQL, maintains SQL features.
   - Examples: CockroachDB, NuoDB.

9. **Spatial DBMS**:
   - Manages spatial data (geographical information).
   - Performs spatial queries and analysis.
   - Used in GIS applications, location-based services.
   - Examples: PostGIS (extension for PostgreSQL), Oracle Spatial.

10. **Multimodel DBMS**:
    - Supports multiple data models within one system.
    - Combines features of different types of DBMS.
    - Examples: ArangoDB, Couchbase.
